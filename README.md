Port of MapReduce pruner to Java/Hadoop

To simplify the use of phylogenetic trees in scientific research, a program has been written
to extract subsets from arbitrary-size trees. This program uses the MapReduce algorithm(originated from Google)
of the Apache Hadoop infrastructure to reduce the post-order traversal data of a tree, in order to extract the data
of the subtree. Once the subset data has been saved in a Newick format file, it can be used for research purposes.
